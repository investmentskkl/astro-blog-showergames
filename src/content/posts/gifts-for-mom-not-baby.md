Whether she’s a first-timer or a seasoned pro, she deserves gifts that **pamper, support, and spoil** her a little. Here are our favorite baby shower gifts *just for mom* — because she’s earned it.

## 1. 💆‍♀️ A Postpartum Spa Kit

Think bath soaks, under-eye masks, cozy slippers, and a little something lavender-scented. Put together a small box of treats just for her to unwind.

## 2. 🍽️ Meal Delivery Service

Skip the casseroles. A gift card for prepared meals (like Daily Harvest or Factor) can be a lifesaver when she’s too tired to think, much less cook.

## 6. 🎧 Premium Headphones or Earbuds

Perfect for naps, white noise, or sneaking in a podcast while nursing. It’s self-care that plugs in.
